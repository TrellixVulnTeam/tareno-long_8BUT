"""
This is config file for your application. This file needs to be
called at the start of every script as standard practice.

The main purposes is to a) ensure directory behaviour is constant regardless
of where you run your script b) certain installation based settings can be
modified by the end user. On the last point, this isnt a place for script
parameters, but general installation based settings and configurations.

IMPORTANT: This file must be included but does not need to be used.
You can delete the contents below. Eventually, a centralised system
will make use of this file (or something similar) to 'compile' your apps.

Feel free to play around and make use of it though in your own way.
